/*Steps for adding a node after given node
Let the pointer to this given node be next_node and the data of the new node to be added as new_data. 

Check if the next_node is NULL or not. If itâ€™s NULL, return from the function because any new node can not be added before a NULL
Allocate memory for the new node, let it be called new_node
Set new_node->data = new_data
Set the previous pointer of this new_node as the previous node of the next_node, new_node->prev = next_node->prev
Set the previous pointer of the next_node as the new_node, next_node->prev = new_node
Set the next pointer of this new_node as the next_node, new_node->next = next_node;
If the previous node of the new_node is not NULL, then set the next pointer of this previous node as new_node, new_node->prev->next = new_node
Else, if the prev of new_node is NULL, it will be the new head node. So, make (*head_ref) = new_node.*/


/*Basic concept clearing 
node1.data = This means that node1 is the object & is of datatype node.We can access the object/members of object directly using a .(dot operator)
node2->data = This means that node2 is a pointer that points to an object & is of datatype node* . We use this pointer (node2) to access the object/members of the object that the pointer points to by using a ->(arrow operator).*/
